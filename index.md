<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology at [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/departments/medicine). I am fortunate to be supervised with [Dr. Ang Li](https://www.bcm.edu/research/faculty-labs/ang-li-lab), [Dr. Rushad Patell](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/161737), and [Dr. Barbara Lam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbaralam/) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School. I received my M.D./Ph.D. in Clinical Medicine at [Tongji Medical College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_Medical_College) of [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yu Hu](https://www.whuh.com/info/1144/6552.htm).

My research lies at the intersection of **real world evidence** and **clinical machine learning** -- with a particular emphasis on how technology improves patient engagement and the application of machine learning to clinical settings.
